<h1>General</h1>
</a>


Xrefactory is a refactoring development environment for Java.  Its
functions can be accessed via the 'Plugins->Xrefactory' submenu of the
main menu bar.  Optionally the most frequent functions can be bind on
shortcuts. Xrefactory can be customized via standard jEdit
customization dialog.

<h2>Quick start</h2>


To quickly start working with Xrefactory just invoke any of its
functions.  You will be asked for creation of a project. Then
Xrefactory will create its database for the project and is ready for
use.

<h2>Projects</h2>


Xrefactory is project based, you will need to create and maintain
description of your projects. Particularity of Xrefactory projects is
possibility of autodetection. Xrefactory detects the 'active project'
from the path of currently edited file.  Each project contains list of
'autodetection directories' specifying when the project should be
triggered 'active'.  Only one project at the time can be active. In
consequence 'autodetection directories' have to be distinct for all
projects. Information about the selected 'active project' is displayed
after each browsing action in the bottom information line of the
editor.

<p>
NOTE: Project autodetection directories are (in general) not the
same as directories containing project files. Project files can
contains common libraries used in many projects, while project
detection directory should be the directory which is project specific,
i.e. directory containing project specific files not shared with other
projects.


<h2>Tags</h2>


The main object Xrefactory works with are 'Tags'.  Each project has
its Tags stored in files specified by user.  Tags contain informations
about your project sources.  In particular, informations about all
symbols, their linking properties, definition place(s) and all usages.
Tags can be split into any number of files. The number of tag files is
specified by user. Larger number makes browsing faster, but makes
creation and update of Tags slower.  The maintenance of tags is in
major part automatic.  However it may happens that tags will become
inconsistent.  Then it is recommended to re-create tags manually.

<h2>Xref task</h2>

Xrefactory cooperates with  an external task 'xref',  if you
feel that the task has run  into an inconsistent state, 
you  can invoke the 'Kill xref task' function.


<br><br>
<a name="completion">
<h1>Completion</h1>
</a>

Completion is implemented with the function 'Complete' and usually is
bind to 'Control Space' hot-key. Completion tries to complete
identifier before the caret by contextually appropriate strings. Xrefactory is
recognizing around 15 different context among them, completion of
class attributes, classes, methods parameters, variable definitions,
etc. When several possibilities are available the completion dialog
appears.


<h2>Completion Dialog</h2>


Each line of the dialog contains following informations: the identifier
to insert, the inheritance level and the class where proposed symbol
is defined, and the full definition of the symbol.

Symbol can be selected using standard motion keys.  Following special
keys are available:

<table> 
<tr>
	<td>&lt;return></td><td>- close dialog and insert completion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&lt;space></td><td>- inspect definition (or javadoc) of the symbol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&lt;escape></td><td>- return to invocation place and close dialog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&lt;alt>&lt;escape></td><td>- close dialog.</td>
</tr>
</table>

When completing a type name, fully qualified names of classes from jar
archives are proposed. When selecting such name, an additional dialog
appears proposing you to add new import clause.


<br><br>
<a name="browser">
<h1>Browser</h1>
</a>


Xrefactory browser allows to resolve any symbol in source file, 
inspect its definition and all usages. Following four basic functions
are available for browsing and it is usual to bind them to hot-keys: 
<ul>
<li>Browser - Browse Symbol from Editor and Goto Definition
<li>Browser - Backward
<li>Browser - Previous Reference
<li>Browser - Next Reference.
</ul>

<p> When browsing a symbol, you first need to fix it by moving the
caret on an occurrence of the symbol and invoking 'Browse Symbol from 
Editor and Goto Definition' function. In the case of success the caret
is moved to the definition of the symbol. This is because
inspecting definition is the most usual browsing function and it is
performed together with the resolution. In case you are trying to
browse a virtual method and the unique definition can not be determined by
static analysis, the <a href="#browserdialog">Browser
Dialog</A> is opened for manual resolution.  After successful
resolution you can inspect all usages of the symbol using 'Previous'
and 'Next Reference' functions.

<p> Browser allows simultaneous browsing of multiple symbols. For
example, let's imagine you are browsing all usages of a variable
'variable' and you see that it is used as a parameter of a method
'method'.  So, you wish to find the definition of the 'method'. In
this situation simply put caret on the 'method' and invoke 'Push
Symbol and Goto Definition' once more time. You will be moved to the
definition of the 'method' and you can inspect its code. After this
you wish to continue browsing remaining usages of the 'variable'. But
when you try to use 'Previous' and 'Next Reference' you see that those
functions are now inspecting all usages of the 'method' (not
'variable' as you wish).  In this situation you first need to invoke
the function 'Backward'. After this, the 'Previous' and 'Next
Reference' functions works with usages of the 'variable'.

<p>
As illustrated by this example, Xrefactory browser is based on browser
stack. Newly browsed symbols are
pushed on the top of the stack by the function 'Browse Symbol from 
Editor and Goto Definition'. Functions 'Previous' and 'Next Reference' are inspecting
previous and next usage of the symbol placed on the top of the
stack. Function 'Backward' is removing one element from the top
of the stack.

<p> It is possible to push back an element which was poped from the
stack by error. This is done with the function 'Browser - Forward'.
This function is particularly useful when using visualization of the
browser stack in the Browser Dialog.

<p> Another way how to push references onto browser stack is the
function: 'Browser - Browse Name from Editor and Goto
Definition'. This function takes a string pointed by the caret, scans
the Tag file and pushes ALL symbols having this name. No semantic
information such as scopes or overloading resolution is taken
into account. This is why this function is useful to find
definition of a known symbol rather than to browse an existing code.
Also this function does not permit browsing of local
symbols, such as local variables, parameters and labels, as they are
not recorded in global Tag file.

<a name="browserdialog">
<h2>Browser Dialog</h2>
</a>

Browser dialog allows visualization of Xrefactory browser stack by
displaying its top element.  It contains two major information panes.
Information displayed in information panes can be filtered by
selecting filter from combo boxes placed above.

<h3>Toolbar</h3>

Browser toolbar contains four buttons putting new symbol(s) onto browser
stack.

<ul>

<li> <b>Browse Symbol and Goto Definition</b>. This function parses
the buffer opened in the editor pane and resolves the symbol pointed by the
caret. This symbol is then pushed onto the browser stack. Then the caret
is moved to the definition of the symbol. This is the most used browsing function.
If you want to browse a symbol
from your program, this is the function to be used. Other functions are
used for few specific cases when this function can not do the job.

<li> <b>Browse Name and Goto Definition</b>. This function takes the
identifier pointed by the caret in the editor pane of jEdit and pushes onto the
 stack all global symbols having this name. No semantic information is examined, no
overload or other resolution is made. This function allows to browse only references
of global project symbols, it does not allow to browse local variables, method
parameters and other local symbols.

<li><b>Browse File Local Unused Symbols</b>. This function parses
the buffer opened in the editor pane and pushes onto browser stack all unused
symbols with local scope. Those are local variables, method parameters, but
also labels and import statements, so this function can be used to purge
imports.


<li><b>Browse Global Unused Symbols</b>. This functions scans Tags and pushes
them onto the browser stack.

</ul>

Following four other functions are accessible from Toolbar:

<ul>
<li><b>Backward</b>. Go back to the previously browsed symbol.

<li><b>Forward</b>. Go forward to the symbol (if any) from where you went back.

<li><b>Previous Reference</b>. Move to the previous reference of currently browsed symbol.

<li><b>Next Reference</b>. Move to the next reference of currently browsed symbol.
</ul>


<h3>Browse name</h3>

The browse name text field can be used to enter manually a name
to be pushed onto the browser stack. This may be used when you wish to browse
a symbol which you do not see in your source code. Otherwise, it is more natural to
use either "Browse Name and Goto Definition" or "Browse Symbol and Goto Definition"
funtion.

<h3>Symbol Pane</h3>

The symbol information pane contains symbol names, profile informations
and classes where those symbols are defined. Window is organized as
tree, where after each symbol follows inheritance subtree relevant for
this symbol. Tree contains classes defining the symbol and (sub)
classes where symbol is syntactically referred. After class name
follows number of references.

<p>
<B>Mouse key bindings</B>:
<table> 
<tr>
	<td>&lt;mouse-left-button></td><td>- select only one class references and inspect definition reference (or javadoc).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&lt;mouse-right-button></td><td>- toggle select/unselect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&lt;SHIFT>&lt;mouse-left-button></td><td>- toggle select/unselect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>&lt;CTRL>&lt;mouse-left-button></td><td>- inspect class (or its javadoc).</td>
</tr>
</table>



<p>
<B>Available filters</B>:
<table> 
<tr>
 <td>Equal name</td><td>- all symbols of given name are displayed. Class tree is not restricted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Equal profile</td><td>- the browsed symbol is displayed. Class tree is not restricted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>Relevant</td><td>- the browsed symbol is displayed. Class tree does not display classes not related to class of browsed symbol.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>References Pane</h3>

The references pane contains list of
references. Each reference is listed together with corresponding line
of source code. The list is selectable and selected reference is
automatically opened in editor.
<p>
Meaning of <B>filters for classes</B>:
<table> 
<tr>
<td>Level 3</td><td>: Only definitions and declarations are shown.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Level 2</td><td>: as level 3 plus  usages in the EXTENDS and IMPLEMENTS clauses</td>
</tr><tr><td>Level 1</td><td>: as level 2  plus all usages  in the top level  scope (in global
         vars and method definitions). This can be used  to see all
         the methods working with a particular type.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Level 0</td><td>: all references are shown.</td>
</tr>
</table> 

<p>
Meaning of <B>filters for variables</B>:
<table> 
<tr>
<td>Level 3</td><td>: only definition and declarations are shown. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Level 2</td><td>: as level 3 plus l-value usages. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Level 1</td><td>: (unused in Java language). </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Level 0</td><td>: all references. </td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="retriever">
<h1>Symbol retriever</h1>
</a>


Xrefactory symbol retriever serves  for finding forgotten symbol names
and for  finding symbols  from third parties  libraries.  You  enter a
string to search and Xrefactory  scans Tags (optionally also jar
archives from  the claspath). All symbols matching  entered string are
reported.


<p>
Entered strings are interpreted as shell expressions and are composed
from a sequence of characters possibly containing wild
characters. Following wild characters can be used: * expands to any
(possibly empty) string, ?  expands to any single character and
[...]  pair expands to one of enclosed characters.  Ranges of
characters can be included between [ and ], so for example [a-zA-Z]
matches any letter, [0-9] matches any digit, as it is usual in shell
expressions. If the first character following the [ is a ^ then the
sense of expansion is inversed, for example [^0-9] expands to any
non-digit character.  A symbol is reported only if it completely
matches the searched string.  Method profile is considered
as part  of the name  of the method, for example,  the expression
*(*int*) will report all methods taking at least one parameter of type
int.  Letters are considered case unsensitive except letters enclosed
between [ and ].


<p> For example the expression *get* will report all symbols
containing the string get, for example symbols getField and Target
will match.  Expression get* will report all symbols starting by the
string 'get'. Expression [A-Z]* will report all symbols starting by an
upper case letter. Expression get[abc0-2]* will report all symbols
starting by the string 'get' followed by one of characters a,b,c,0,1,2 followed
by any (possibly empty) string, so for example getact
will match, but getAccount will not.


<p>
If  you  enter  an expression  which  does  not  contain any  of  wild
characters *,  ?  or  [ then  Xrefactory reports all symbols containing
entered string.  For example, entering get as the expression is equivalent 
to entering *get*.

<a name="refactorer">
<h1>Refactorer</h1>
</a>



Refactoring is a software development and maintenance process where
the source code is changed in such a way that it does not alter the
external behavior. Xrefactory offers automatic support for several
general refactoring patterns available via refactorer function.
Whenever it is possible it also checks that performed modifications do
not change program behaviour. For example, in case of symbol renaming,
Xrefactory checks whether renamed symbol does not clash with an
existing one, etc.

<p>
Invocation of refactorer will display a pop up menu with refactorings
available for symbol pointed by the caret. Selection of one of items will
perform the refactoring.
