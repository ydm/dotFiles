<h1>Xref task used as server for editing commands</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>


When xref is invoked with option "-task_regime_server", it acts like a
server  reading  input  options  from  standard  input  and  producing
answers on the standard output. 

<p>
Because on majority of OS,  pipes are slower than temporary files, two
pipes (standard input and output)  are used only for small quantity of
datas and their main purpose is synchronisation of editing environment
and xref task.

<p>
The  xref  task expects  a  suite of  input  options  finished by  the
"end-of-options" string. Options are basically those which can be used
on  command line  (with exception  of  -I and  -D options).   Moreover
numerous special options not documented in the xref manual page can be
used. One  of options should specify  the output file  for the answer.
In such  case the xref  task computes the  answer, stores it  into the
output file  and then  it writes the  "<sync>" string on  its standard
output.

<p>
NOTE:

If you wish  to examine the exact communication  between xref task and
Emacs editor, you can edit the xref.el file and change the line:

<pre>

(defvar xref-debug-mode nil)
</pre>
to:
<pre>
(defvar xref-debug-mode t)

</pre>

This  will cause that  Emacs will  display all  informations exchanged
with xref task.



<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>

The simplest example of xref  comunication protocol is invocation of a
completion  function.   Let's  consider   that  we  have  a  file  /tmp/xrefactory.tmp
containing the following text:

<pre>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
struct toto {int x,y;} t;

main() {
  t.
  ;
  ma
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

following suite  of commands will call  xref server task,  ask for all
completions after "t." string at line  4 (offset 40), then it will ask
for completion on line 6 (offset 49). In the following, text written 
by hand is displayed in bold, answers from computer are in plain text.

<pre>


vittek:~/tmp/test><b>xref -task_regime_server -xrefactory-II
-olcxcomplet
-olcursor=40
/tmp/xrefactory.tmp
end-of-options

</b>
&lt;all-completions nofocus=0 len=19>x  :int x
y  :int y&lt;/all-completions>
&lt;sync>

<b>-olcxcomplet
-olcursor=49
/tmp/xrefactory.tmp
end-of-options

</b>
&lt;goto>
&lt;position-lc line=6 col=2 len=25>/tmp/xrefactory.tmp&lt;/position-lc>
&lt;/goto>
&lt;single-completion len=4>main&lt;/single-completion>
&lt;sync>


</pre>

The first answer means that the list:
<pre>
x  :int x
y  :int y
</pre>
of possible completions should be displayed. The second answer is asking for moving to 
the line 6 and column 2 of the file <i>/tmp/xrefactory.tmp</i> and inserting
there the string <i>main</i>, which is the only completion.

<h5>Using output file</h5>


Following example demonstrates usage of a temporary file to get the output from xref task.
In this case the answer is not
produced on the standard output, but into a file. Only the <i>&lt;sync></i> record is
passed via standard output.

<pre>


vittek:~/tmp/test><b>xref -task_regime_server -xrefactory-II
-olcxcomplet
-olcursor=49
-o /tmp/xrefactory.out
/tmp/xrefactory.tmp
end-of-options

</b>
&lt;sync>

vittek:~/tmp/test><b>cat /tmp/xrefactory.out</b>
&lt;goto>
 &lt;position-lc line=6 col=2 len=25>/tmp/xrefactory.tmp&lt;/position-lc>
&lt;/goto>
&lt;single-completion len=4>main&lt;/single-completion>
vittek:~/tmp/test>

</pre>


<h5>Using temporary input file</h5>

Usualy when completion is invoked from an editor, the currently edited file
is not saved. The completion is not expected to save it neither. However in order
to pass it to the <i>xref</i> task, the file has to be stored somewhere
in the file system. Xrefactory offers special mecanism for this situation. It allows
to specify that a temporary file is storing the current version of a source file.
For example:

<pre>


vittek:~/tmp/test><b>xref -task_regime_server -xrefactory-II
-olcxcomplet
-olcursor=49
-preload /home/vittek/tmp/test/toto.c /tmp/xrefactory.tmp
-o /tmp/xrefactory.out
/home/vittek/tmp/test/toto.c
end-of-options
</b>

&lt;sync>

vittek:~/tmp/test><b>cat /tmp/xrefactory.out</b>
&lt;goto>
 &lt;position-lc line=6 col=2 len=25>/home/vittek/tmp/test/toto.c&lt;/position-lc>
&lt;/goto>
&lt;single-completion len=4>main&lt;/single-completion>


</pre>
