    This directory contains Xrefactory distribution files.

Please, choose the most appropriate platform. If none (or you have some 
troubles) select the 'xref-any.tar.gz' file for the newest source based
portable version.

After having download the selected file, you should decompress it by 
the "gunzip xref-xxx.tar.gz" command and then de-tar it by the 
"tar xfv xref-xxx.tar" command. To finish the installation type:

	sh ./xrefsetup

in the created directory.

Enjoy!

Marian.
