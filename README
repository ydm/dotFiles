tt.. I'm currently sorting and rewriting my dotFiles

TOP TODOS:
        1) Write install script
        2) Write update script (git pull / svn / etc... for all dependencies)
        3) Write uninstall script

My dotFiles.

These include configurations for:
        emacs
        xmonad

	outdated:
        git (see ./Makefile)

./Emacs.gitignore is retrieved from https://github.com/github/gitignore

My Emacs config is made up of:
    .emacs
    less-css-mode from https://github.com/purcell/less-css-mode.git

    coffee-mode (elpa)
    rainbow-mode (elpa)

    TODO:
    autocomplete: http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/
    yasnippet: elpa

To install:
        make install (that's broken actually... TODO)
To uninstall:
        make uninstall

Dependencies:
        git (make install needs it to download packages)
        xmodmap (to map the Control key to Caps Lock)
